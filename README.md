# YouTube Home Page Replica
This repository contains an HTML/CSS project (within the youtube-project file) that I created based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&ab_channel=SuperSimpleDev

The website contains most of the features from the YouTube homepage, including videos and links to those videos, video stat information, 
a header with the search bar and other relevant buttons, and a sidebar with relevant buttons. All the videos have interactive links built into them and webpage 
has an interactive design. 

This repository also contains some other miscellaneous files that I used to practice HTML/CSS techniques.
